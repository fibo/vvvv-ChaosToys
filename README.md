Apparently simple equations can have unpredictable behaviuor, with completely different results depending on initial conditions ... a butterfly flapping its wings in Tokyo could cause tornadoes in California.

As much chaos toys I add, as more I realize that chaotic behaviour is more natural and when you can understand and solve a dynamical system you are in a very rare situation.
